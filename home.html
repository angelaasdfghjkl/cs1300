    <h1>~*Check Out*~ the CVS Self-Checkout</h1>
    <p>My neighborhood CVS is a well-frequented establishment and thus it comes as no surprise that the interface I chose to critique is the self-checkout machine there. Due to the recent pandemic, the usage of the machine has spiked and I was curious how others might feel about the machine. The problem the self-checkout machines are trying to solve is alleviate the long checkout lines and offer customers an alternative to pay for their items without a cashier. My objective is to analyze this interface through personas and mental models derived from customer interactions. The self-checkout machine itself consists of five major components: the barcode scanner, payment section (credit/debit card or cash), bagging area, coupon insertion area, and main touchscreen registry area. A customer’s journey begins at the scanner when 1) they scan the item’s barcode and continues to 2) the bagging area where its weight is cross-reference to make sure the correct item has been registered, then the user proceeds to 3) pay for their item with cash/credit/debit and 4) sometimes coupons via the coupon insertion area, and ultimately ends with 5) the receipt printer.
    </p>
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>The customers who frequent this CVS pharmacy have expressed that they use the self-checkout machine frequently with minimal trouble. However, here are some trends I’ve noticed
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The line at the cashier counters is longer than that at the machines. The line generally moves more quickly at the machines as well</li>
    <li>It’s not uncommon for users to scan items twice due to the scanner’s sensitivity</li>
    <li>Some have trouble with the coupon insertion process, as certain coupons cause errors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
    <p>I interviewed 3 different customers and here is a summary of our conversation. </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Do you have a preference of using the machine or going to the cashier? </li> All users preferred using the machine.
    <li>Why do you use the machine over the alternative?</li> Many cited Covid-19 as a reason for using the machine to avoid human contact. They would rather mitigate transmission risks by standing in a shorter line at the machine v.s. the long wait at the cashiers. Users also expressed that they liked the machine even prior to Covid because it’s usually faster and more efficient than lining up for the cashier.

    <li>Do you have any general critiques of the interface?</li> Some mentioned that the credit card interface can be unreliable, sometimes the chip reader requires multiple insertion attempts. Others brought up that the machine fails to scan some items and doesn’t recognize certain coupons correctly. The main problem is technical difficulty or payment errors that can necessitate a store worker’s override code at times. Overall, the interface is easy and intuitive for the users.

    <li>What are some features that make the interface useful/attractive to you?</li> The two main factors were speed and convenience in not needing to interact with another human. This is both health-related because of Covid-19 advisory as well as social for users who prefer not talking to a human. One particular user emphasized their social anxiety and usually would not talk to a store worker unless necessary. He brought up an instance where his credit card was rejected and he felt immense embarrassment in front of the store clerk.
    <li>If you were to redesign or change any feature of the interface, what would you propose?</li>
    Users thought redesigns should include touchless payment methods and more technology to fix issues of scanning and payment errors. The users seemed very receptive to innovative technology and one brought up the new contactless self-checkout kiosks at Walmart as well as the “Amazon Go” cashierless pilot stores.
</ol>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>After reviewing the findings from my observational interview, I decided to incorporate a few traits and key interactions into personas in order to gauge the users’ mental model. Below are two archetypal characters that fit two narratives: Hurried Harriet and Calm Connor.</p>

    <p>1) Hurried Harriet is a 24-year-old graduate engineering student from NYU who thrives in a fast-paced urban environment. She is the epitome of an impatient New Yorker who seeks efficiency and speed with everything she does. She often rushes through her tasks and thus struggles with the scanner on the CVS self-checkout machine. Harriet’s mental model assumes that the machine will be the fastest way to checkout but accidentally scans her items twice due to her hurried clumsiness. In her mission to seek the quickest ways to complete everything, Harriet ironically delays the experience by stumbling through the interface- from the scanner to the credit card chip reader. Harriet represents the demographic of young urbanites who often juggle their myriad responsibilities hastily and absent-mindedly. </p>

    <p>2) Calm Conrad is a 30-year-old male who is a full-time stay-at-home dad. Connor is frugal and resourceful, often clipping coupons and finding ways to save money. He always tries to get more bang for his buck, even if that means spending more time comparing prices. Today is a leisurely Saturday and Conrad is shopping for Halloween decorations for the family at multiple craft stores and local drugstores. Though normally careful and methodical, Connor runs into problems with the interface due to his insistence on stacking multiple coupons in tandem and applying them to items that are already on sale. Connor also ponders the possibility of returning items through the interface and is always curious of new ways to save money. He is the perfect archetype of family-oriented individuals who often explore different ways to help their family stay on budget and in style.</p>
    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p>This is the user journey of Hurried Harriet who messes up on multiple steps of the checkout process due to her rushed behavior and clumsy demeanor. She depicts the problematic mechanism of the credit card reader and the scanner as she attempts the payment process as fast as possible.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The CVS self-checkout machine offers a great alternative for those who prefer a cashierless process in the age of social distancing and mass consumption. Due to the ubiquity of this public interface, it is critical for the designer to build it with a diverse array of personas and mental models in mind. From this experience, I learned the importance of analyzing behavioral interviews and forming objective observations. Users often contemplate multiple options when they’re on their user journey so it’s vital to imagine their thought process and predict problems that may arise. The interface itself caused problems for customers who deviate a bit from the standard user- a clumsy university student and an overly frugal homemaker. The self-checkout machine has served many well but its interface can always be improved with more user journeys in mind.</p>

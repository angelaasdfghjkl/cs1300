    <h1>Check Out the CVS Self-Checkout</h1>
    <p>My neighborhood CVS is a well-frequented establishment and thus it comes as no surprise that the interface I chose to critique is the self-checkout machine there. Due to the recent pandemic, the usage of the machine has spiked and I was curious how others might feel about the machine. The problem the self-checkout machines are trying to solve is alleviate the long checkout lines and offer customers an alternative to pay for their items without a cashier. My objective is to analyze this interface through personas and mental models derived from customer interactions. The self-checkout machine itself consists of five major components: the barcode scanner, payment section (credit/debit card or cash), bagging area, coupon insertion area, and main touchscreen registry area. A customer’s journey begins at the scanner when 1) they scan the item’s barcode and continues to 2) the bagging area where its weight is cross-reference to make sure the correct item has been registered, then the user proceeds to 3) pay for their item with cash/credit/debit and 4) sometimes coupons via the coupon insertion area, and ultimately ends with 5) the receipt printer.

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>The customers who frequent this CVS pharmacy have expressed that they use the self-checkout machine frequently with minimal trouble. However, here are some trends I’ve noticed
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The line at the cashier counters is longer than that at the machines. The line generally moves more quickly at the machines as well</li>
    <li>It’s not uncommon for users to scan items twice due to the scanner’s sensitivity</li>
    <li>Some have trouble with the coupon insertion process, as certain coupons cause errors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
    <p>I interviewed 3 different customers and here is a summary of our conversation. </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Do you have a preference of using the machine or going to the cashier?
    All users preferred using the machine.</li> <p>Q1answer</p>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li> Ya
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
</ol>

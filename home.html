    <p>My neighborhood CVS is a well-frequented establishment and thus it comes as no surprise that the interface I chose to critique is the self-checkout machine there. Due to the recent pandemic, the usage of the machine has spiked and I was curious how others might feel about the machine. The problem the self-checkout machines are trying to solve is alleviate the long checkout lines and offer customers an alternative to pay for their items without a cashier. My objective is to analyze this interface through personas and mental models derived from customer interactions. The self-checkout machine itself consists of five major components: the barcode scanner, payment section (credit/debit card or cash), bagging area, coupon insertion area, and main touchscreen registry area. A customer’s journey begins at the scanner when 1) they scan the item’s barcode and continues to 2) the bagging area where its weight is cross-reference to make sure the correct item has been registered, then the user proceeds to 3) pay for their item with cash/credit/debit and 4) sometimes coupons via the coupon insertion area, and ultimately ends with 5) the receipt printer.
